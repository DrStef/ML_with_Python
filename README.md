### Simple Linear Regression

We have downloaded a fuel consumption dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
Linear Regression for predicting: "CO2 Emission (g) v. Fuel consumption (l)"

### Multiple Linear regression 

x = np.asanyarray(test[['ENGINESIZE','CYLINDERS','FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB']])
y = np.asanyarray(test[['CO2EMISSIONS']])

### Polynomial Regression

train_x = np.asanyarray(train[['ENGINESIZE']])
train_y = np.asanyarray(train[['CO2EMISSIONS']])

### Recommandation System 
Create a recommendation system using Content Based filtering 
Now, let's take a look at how to implement Content-Based or Item-Item recommendation systems. This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we're going to try to figure out the input's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.

###  Recommendation system based on collaborative filtering
Create recommendation system based on collaborative filtering
The first technique we're going to take a look at is called Collaborative Filtering, which is also known as User-User Filtering. As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one we will be using here is going to be based on the Pearson Correlation Function.
